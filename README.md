 HR_ANALYSIS_USING_SQLProject Overview

This project involves analyzing employee retention data from two tables, HR1 and HR2, comprising a total of 50,000 records. By exploring various key performance indicators (KPIs), we aim to gain insights into factors affecting employee attrition, satisfaction, and other metrics crucial for HR decision-making.
 Prior to analysis, data cleaning was performed in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency. The cleaned data includes calculated fields such as date of joining, year of joining, month of joining, etc., which were then imported into an SQL database for further analysis.

Database Description
The HR dataset used in this project was provided by the institute where I completed a course.
The HR analytics database consists of two tables:

HR1: Contains employee information including employee ID, gender, age, department, job role, education field, monthly income, years since last promotion, work life balance, and attrition status.
HR2: Provides additional details such as hourly rate (for hourly employees), working years, and satisfaction score.
